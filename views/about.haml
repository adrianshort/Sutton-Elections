%h1 How the council election works

%p On 6 May 2010 you get to choose your local councillors and to decide who runs Sutton Council for the next four years.

%p The borough is divided into 18 areas called wards.

%p Each ward has three councillors. That makes 54 councillors for the whole borough.

%p You get three votes to choose three councillors for your ward from the list of candidates.

%p The three people with the most votes in each ward become the councillors for that ward.

%p If a political party gets 28 or more councillors they get to run the council and decide its policies and services until the next election in four years time.

%h3 Voting by post

%p Anyone can apply to vote by post.

%p If you are registered to vote by post you won't be allowed to vote at a polling station.

%h3 Asking someone to vote for you

%p
  You can choose to have someone vote for you at the polling station. This is called a
